Saya berpartisipasi dalam mengikuti **Hackthon Data Fair** yang diselenggarakan oleh **Hacktiv8 Indonesia**

## Project 1 <br>

**Costumer Prediction using machine learning**

## Context

A customer event is an alternative that may be more expensive than participating in a fair, but the profitability is many times higher. People invited and operating in the field will come to the event. Achieving contact with quality is significantly higher.

A customer event is a good place to emphasize the latest biggest achievements, present new products, or keep good contact in a cozy-free atmosphere with your customers and partners. Why not invite to the event all of the potential customers with whom it is good to speak on-site.

## Task
As a data scientist, we will help activists who hold events to increase profits from selling products that are exhibited at the event.
With the help of computers, we will create machine learning models that can predict whether customers who come to the event will buy the products that we show at the event.

what are you waiting for, let's create a machine learning model that can increase the profit performance of these events. â“‚

## Project 2 <br>

**BTC Price Predictor**

## Context
Most people who want to invest or just want to know the movement of crypto prices, especially Bitcoin (BTC) are still confused about bitcoin price movements going forward. So I try to make an idea where will the bitcoin price move for the next 60 days?

## Task
Therefore I want to create a model with an LSTM architecture that can predict bitcoin movements for the next 60 days. The model I made has a very small loss and an accuracy of 97%.
